Variable yytext is a pointer to the matched string (NULL-terminated) and yyleng is the length of the matched string. Variable yyout is the output file and defaults to stdout. Function yywrap is called by lex when input is exhausted. Return 1 if you are done or 0 if more processing is required.
Every C program requires a main function. In this case we simply call yylex that is the main entry-point for lex.
Some implementations of lex include copies of main and yywrap in a library thus eliminating the need to code them explicitly.
This is why our first example, the shortest lex program, functioned properly.
